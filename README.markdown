# Readability

This project is a pseudo-fork of [Arc90](http://arc90.com/)'s excellent [Readability bookmarklet](http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/) and its underpinnings. I use the term "pseudo-forked" because the code is committed to a Subversion repository. I checked it out using [GitSvn](http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html) and created a new Git remote to manage any changes I may make.

Only the [trunk of this project](http://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/source/browse/) was cloned and it was done at [r155](http://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/source/list).
